    			<h1>Unique Boutique</h1>
          <h2> A Charlotte brick-and-mortar defies odds
</h2>
          <h3>By Molly Weybright, Alexandra Hehlen, Alma Washington and Millie Isiminger</h3>

    <div class="container wrap">

<p>On the edge of downtown Charlotte, N.C. lies a truly unique boutique that brilliantly combines the art of fashion with the art of interpersonal skills. Stepping through the paned glass doors of Capitol Boutique is like stepping into Manhattan or Milan, an apex of fashion. The store is timeless, enchanting. One might expect Audrey Hepburn to be lounging on the green chaise fingering the hems of colorful dresses and skirts, or Grace Kelly to be feeling silk and leather in search of the perfect purse.</p>
<p>In a store where millions of dollars of merchandise hangs from racks and rests on tables it seems natural to feel distanced from the items, as if they should be inside glass cases or roped off like the works of art they are. But, with a combination of natural light, soft alt-rock music and amiable staff, Capitol becomes a store where shoppers can run their hands along the racks of clothes just to feel the fabrics change beneath their fingers. In fact, it&rsquo;s encouraged. Silk shifts to lace and lace turns to velvet as customers experience all that Capitol has to offer. </p>
<p>After nearly 20 years in business, owner Laura Vinroot Poole has perfected the art of the in-store experience. By paying attention to every facet of Capitol&mdash;atmosphere, temperature, music, lighting, textures and even smell&mdash;Poole has created a masterpiece. At a time when brick-and-mortar stores are being run out of business by e-commerce, she has found the perfect equation for keeping her home-grown business strong. The secret to her success? Knowing her clientele, understanding their city and molding her store to fit those people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t try to be New Yorkers, we don&rsquo;t try to be Texans,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We try to do things that are completely relevant to Charlotteans.&rdquo; </p>
<h1>Decline in Brick-and-Mortar</h1>
<p>Earlier this year, CNN Money cited a Credit Suisse report that predicted 8,600 brick-and-mortar stores to close in 2017. The report also stated that last year 2,056 stores closed, and during the recession in 2008, the worst year on record, 6,163 stores closed down. </p>
<p>Poole said she thinks the increase in closures stems from the speed at which the world is changing and the inability of many small business owners to adapt fast enough, especially those that have been in business for a long time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The people that are not doing well are the people that are not changing and that are not thinking every day &lsquo;How can we do this better? How can we stay relevant and stay exciting for our clients?&rsquo;,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>That adaptability is much of what Poole attributes her success to over the past two decades, particularly following the 2008 recession, a time that she feels defined her business as it is today.</p>
<p>The recession was a big driver in online retail, she said, as people were able to find any item at any time from any store, often at discounted prices. </p>
<p>So, to combat that online competition, Poole did two things: upgraded her online presence with a shoppable website and active social media pages and implemented in-store techniques to make the Capitol shopping experience unrivaled and unforgettable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What occurred to me was that you can really buy anything anywhere, and you still can,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But the value is in the experience, it&rsquo;s in the customer service, it&rsquo;s in the space where you can buy it and the escape.&rdquo;</p>

<h1>Capitol&rsquo;s Online Presence and House Account</h1>
<p>Kaiti St. George, the social media and marketing director at Capitol, echoed Poole&rsquo;s statement that a large part of Capitol&rsquo;s continued success is maintaining an active online presence. </p>
<p>Oftentimes, St. George said, after posting about new inventory on social media, she gets an immediate response from customers calling or messaging to put those items on hold. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re constantly trying to keep our customers up to date with all the product inventory,&rdquo; she said. Their daily updates on Facebook, Instagram and their website, capitolcharlotte.com, are incredibly useful tools that help garner clients&rsquo; excitement about the store. </p>
<p>In the wake of the 2008 recession, Poole made critical decisions regarding the future of Capitol and its presence on the internet; These innovative decisions helped keep Capitol alive and still help bring in new business nine years later. Following that success, Poole decided to use her experiences to help other brick-and-mortar stores, she said, and House Account was born. </p>
<p>Sarah Walker, the director of partnerships at House Account, describes it as a web-based team that provides online sales and marketing techniques to start-up brick-and-mortar boutiques. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Instead of a shop having to work with five different third-parties, they only have to work with one,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;All of your customer activity that happens, whether it&rsquo;s in the app or on the website or on House Account&rsquo;s website, it all comes back to one place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walker describes the House Account experience as hyper-focused and very hands on. House Account works with its customers very closely, she said, making contact at least once a week.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having the time and energy to learn plus the resources to invest is intimidating and stressful,&rdquo; she said. House Account allows customers to focus on what Poole and Walker agree is the most important aspect of the luxury boutique: being present in the store and focusing on customer relationships.

<h1>Capitol&rsquo;s In-Store Experience</h1>
<p>While Poole believes that expanding her online presence was crucial to staying relevant and increasing the accessibility of her inventory, she said that the in-store experience that Capitol offers is what keeps clients coming back.</p>
<p>The focus that she and her sales representatives put on the customers rather than on the clothes, Poole said, is one of the most important characteristics that separates Capitol from the average boutique. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not about &lsquo;how much can I sell you?,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about &lsquo;how can we be in a relationship for the rest of your life?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nikki Baber, a senior sales associate at Capitol, echoed that it&rsquo;s that distinction that makes Capitol so successful and unique.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re able to establish that connection and that conversation that&rsquo;s more than just clothes being beautiful on the outside,&rdquo; Baber said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about making sure that [people are] feeling beautiful on the inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>St. George describes the customer-salesperson relationship as all about trust. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just about making a sale, she said, if nothing in the store works for someone, St. George would rather wait for a new shipment to come in than convince the customer to buy something that isn&rsquo;t perfect for them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyone who is visiting we try to make a connection with,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I would say that some of our clients are even national and international now that we have social media.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this dedication to trust and maintaining long-term relationships that keeps customers coming back week after week, year after year, from all over the state, country and world.</p>
<p>But, despite the expansion in Capitol&rsquo;s customer base, the store maintains its focus on Charlotte and the southerners who live there. Baber said it&rsquo;s that hyperawareness of what Charlotte is and wants that keeps business growing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s important that we&rsquo;re sticking to the style of Charlotte,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the style of how we are as southern women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Capitol celebrates its 20th anniversary in the spring of 2018, Poole said she maintains a forward-thinking mindset, learning from the past while focusing on the future.</p>
<p>She is always making improvements and creating new ways to keep Capitol and its market relevant. But, despite the continuing decline in brick-and-mortar stores and the need for many small businesses to capitalize on any and every opportunity, Poole says the one thing she will never do is leave Charlotte.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been asked to expand a million times everywhere&mdash;Atlanta, New York, D.C., Miami&mdash;constantly, but I would never because this is what I know,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the real key. I&rsquo;m buying for Charlotte, I&rsquo;m buying for my clients.&rdquo;</p>
